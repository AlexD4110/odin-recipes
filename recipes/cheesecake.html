    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>4 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh berries or whipped cream for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form the crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over the cooled crust and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside with the door slightly open to prevent cracking. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving.</li>
        <li>Top with fresh berries or whipped cream before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
